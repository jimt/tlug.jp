'''"Nmap: The Network Mapper"''' By ''[[Matthew (Karamoon)]]''

Fyodor's Nmap port scanner is an essential open-source tool for sysadmins, penetration testers and curious people. It is also one of the few pieces of software to have achieved cult status, being featured in movies as bad as The Matrix Reloaded and Die Hard 4.
