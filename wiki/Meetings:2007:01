# '''"True Crypt", by Phillip Tribble'''<br />Phillip will demonstrate what True Crypt does and how to use it. He will show that on the server side, it can be easy to do backups because all you have to backup is a single file rather than multiple files and directories. True Crypt creates a file and mounts the file as a device; if the user creates a 500G junk file, it will be read as a 500MB partition. Also, Phillip will explain the obvious security benefits.
# '''"Recovering Data with GNU/Linux", by Marty Pauley'''<br />There are many ways you can lose data: your hard disk may fail; a disgruntled employee may purge important email from his Outlook folders; your password may be safely locked inside your browser; or you may just not be able to remember where you put your files. Fortunately basic data recovery in these situations is quite easy on a GNU/Linux system and Marty will show us how.
