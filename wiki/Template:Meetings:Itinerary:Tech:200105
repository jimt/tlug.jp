=== Wireless LAN Clinic ===
[[Alberto Tomita]] will be bringing in some equipment where
we can discuss setting up a wireless LAN. Please bring a Laptop
if possible since this will be hands on. There will also be a 
chance to try out Bluetooth cards. 

=== [[Philip Greenspun]] (posssibly) ===
We are hoping Philip will have a chance to come down and
speak on some things he has been working on recently. Please see
