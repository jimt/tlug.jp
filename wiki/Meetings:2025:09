==== Cost ====

We have selected the 3000 JPY course. Drinks are charged separately but come at a 10% discount. The check will be divided evenly at the end, so the cost per person will be ((3000 JPY * 10 reservations) + (0.9 * total cost of drinks ordered)) / (number of people who show up).

If you are planning on attending, please register on the event page at https://tlug.connpass.com/event/367382 so Brian can confirm numbers for the reservation.
