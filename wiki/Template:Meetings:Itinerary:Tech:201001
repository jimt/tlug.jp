'''"Revision Control for Managing Configuration Files, Part I"'''<br/>
By ''[[Curt Sampson]]'' and ''[[Stephen Turnbull]]''

This month, Curt Sampson and Steve Turnbull will talk about revision
control and how to apply it to managing Linux system configuration. We
will describe what revision control is, show examples of at least two
revision control systems (RCS and Git), explain what the issues are when
using these to manage Linux system configuration files, and introduce
etckeeper, which addresses those issues.

Though this is the first part of a series of talks on this subject, this
installment not only gives background necessary to understanding more
sophisticated concepts to be introduced later, but also provides a
useful, self-contained system that will be in itself of benefit to any
systems administrator.
