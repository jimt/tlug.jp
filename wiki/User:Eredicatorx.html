<p>About ME: <img src="me-mirror.jpg" title="fig:me-mirror.jpg" alt="me-mirror.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Erin D. Hughes</p>
<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Unix “Engineer”</p>
<p>I use that term loosely cause while I do solve problems... they are usually more human than computer.</p>
<p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
<p>''What's my Name?</p>
<p>''</p>
<p>Seriously my name is Erin...</p>
<p>I look at most problems as not .... something that needs to be fixed, but something that needs to have all sides understand it, meditated, then resolved in a way that works for the benefit of all involved. A mediator or problem solver if you will.</p>
<p>At this point in my life I find this a strange turn from my younger years, where as a Marine I would in the very basic sense of the word, bludgeon most problems to death. I suppose I do still do that, but instead of a real bludgeoning I stick with problems, and twist arms on both sides till they shake hands, and make up.</p>
<p>My current job for example is the last level of support for the 2nd largest ISP in Tokyo. While most of my peers are concerned with the how of most problems...... I am concerned with the what and the why. Hence I am not the ... best guy at my job, but I am usually regarded as one of the best guys on my job. I marry the what the customers need and sales people want with the how that comes with getting it done.</p>
