'''dot-home for version-control of a users environment configuration''' - Curt Sampson

dot-home[1] lets you have version-controlled user environment
configuration easily distributed amongst many different machines, with
the ability to make changes anywhere and get them out to the other
machines. It also lets you partition your configuration so that
personal configuration doesn't end up on work machines and vice versa,
yet common configuration is shared.
