=== IPv6 at IMASY by Ichiro Fukuhara and Hajimu Umemoto ===
An in-depth look at how IPv6 testing is progressing at leading Japanese organizations in co-ordination with IMASY. Although most of their work is being done with FreeBSD, they are working towards including more Linux interfacing. One thing this talk really showed was that there is a lot of commonality between the FreeBSD group and Linux groups, and a lot of opportunity to work together.

The development of the IPv6 protocol and its experiments are joint and global effort, where Open Software community play a great role. IMASY has been working with WIDE - 6 bone project to the actual experimentation of IPv6 through V6-V4-V6 tunneling. IMASY plans to the first Japanese ISP who OFFICIALLY supports IPv6 protocol for dialup subscribers.

IMASY, Internet Mutual Aid Society is a Yokohama based regional, non-profit Internet Service Provider and network users community. (http://www.imasy.or.jp). All the technical support and operations are performed though the enthusiasts' efforts.

Ichiro Fukuhara is the Chief Engineer of IMASY and responsible for the system design, hardware and software selection, and day to day operations.

Hajimu Umemoto is an Engineer of IMASY who is in charge of the same roles.

=== Corel Netwinder Computer by Jim Tittsler ===

This is one tight package! A 275MHz screamer built into the size of a small router, the Corel Netwinder is a neat system to play with, and could offer commercial customers a solution for small spaces.

He used MagicPoint http://www.mew.org/mgp/ to show an outline.

He has also left a copy of the presentation (without the audio clip :-) at: ftp://starship.skyport.net/pub/crew/jtittsler/tlug-netwinder.tgz The netwinder.mgp file is plain text if you just want to look through the outline.

=== VNC by Urs Roesch ===
VNC lets you have an Xwindow of one computer running Linux, MS, or Solaris on another box. This is a really good way of having MS apps ready to use on your Linux box without having to switch monitors.
