""" Nagios is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of
network problems before your clients, end-users or managers do.
It has been designed to run under the Linux operating system,
but works fine under most *NIX variants as well. The monitoring
daemon runs intermittent checks on hosts and services you
specify using external "plugins" which return status
information to Nagios. When problems are encountered, the
daemon can send notifications out to administrative contacts in
a variety of different ways (email, instant message, SMS,
etc.). Current status information, historical logs, and reports
can all be accessed via a web browser. """

Reminder:  TLUG is a non-profit, self-supported organization. In order
to cover occasional expenses, we hold auctions to raise funds. The
proceeds are saved in the TLUG account and is used for server hardware
maintenance, domain name registration, to rent a meeting space when a
free venue isn't available, etc. Please bring items that you would like to
donate for auction.

== After the meeting ==
