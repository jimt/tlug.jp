Programming music with Sonic Pi by Andreas Kieckens

http://sonic-pi.net

Sonic Pi is a programming language based on Ruby that allows you to     
effectively write music using code. Its author intended it to be  
used both as a live instrument that you're able to gig with, as well 
as a classroom utility to help students learn how to code in a fun 
way. During this presentation Andreas will give a live demonstration 
and also discuss some basics of music theory and how they can be 
applied to programming.

===== Sessions: =====

Joe Larabell will lead a session brainstorming future topics that 
people would light to hear.

===== Short (Lightening) Talks =====

* Edward Middleton "Robot Sumo"

The flow will be open to short talks.  If you would like to do a 
short presentation 5-10 min please get in contact before the meeting 
to insure we have time.
