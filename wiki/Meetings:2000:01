This is a joint event organized by three representatives of
the Linux Community in Japan (Project BLUE, Linux Seminar Working
Group and the Tokyo Linux Users Group) in cooperation with the
Linux Internationalisation Initiative (li18nux) and sponsored
by commercial Linux distributors in Japan.

The guest speaker is Ulrich Drepper (Cygnus Solutions), GNU libc
version 2.x (glibc2) main developer and maintainer. Ulrich will 
talk to us about the most recent developments in glibc 2.2, focusing
on locale implementation and its importance to users who speak
non-latin-based languages (as is the case of Japanese).

Ulrich's talk will be preceded by an introduction to glibc in Linux
and international locale implementation issues. The introductory talk
will be delivered by Yoshito Kawada (IBM Japan), who is an i18n expert
and currently beta-testing the new features in glibc 2.2. 

After the talks, we will continue the discussions informally, over
pizza and beer. There are no pre-requisites for participation, you
are all welcome to join us. The introductory talk will be in Japanese, 
with translation to English; the main talk will be in English, with 
translation to Japanese.  

The seminar room capacitiy is limited to 120 seats, so please register

discussion that follows the talk, to cover the pizza and beer.
