''Dimension reduction, and word embeddings, in Natural Language  
Processing'' - by Darren Cook

Darren will talk about dimension reduction, and word embeddings in  
particular: the technology underlying a lot of the recent advances in

English and Japanese, so you can get a good feel for what bits are  
common between languages, and what still needs language-specific processing.

Darren Cook is a data scientist, and director at QQ Trend Ltd. He is
author of two O'Reilly books, one on low-latency streaming to the
browser, one on the H2O machine learning system. Currently based in the
U.K., after nearly 20 years in Japan. A TLUG member since forever, but
only gets to a meeting once every five years or so...
