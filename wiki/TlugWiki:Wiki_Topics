* File Uploads
** [[User:Hoanga|Al]] requests: Do we allow file uploads to the wiki?  It's turned off
** [[User:Jmglov|Josh]] answers: a big yessir to this!
* SSL - Currently we don't have https so all authentication to this wiki is over plain http.  Should we use https?
** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]: Can someone create a SSL configuration for Apache?  Out of the wikimaster's hands :)
** [[User:Jmglov|Josh]] answers: I don't see a burning need for SSL
* What official pages do we need?
** [[User:Jmglov|jmglov]] suggests:
*** Meetings pages?
*** Officers page
** [[User:edward|Edward]] answer: wouldn't this stuff be better on the main page that way we could solve the rss issues as well.
* RSS
** What type of RSS?
** Look at the top of [[Special:Recentchanges]]. It has Atom and RSS already
*** [[User:Zev|zev]]: Yes, but if we were to make a meetings page that lists the meetings then we could do an RSS feed by adding these parameters to the URL "action=histroy&feed=rss", but I that would just be the edits of that page.  I would like to have the actuall details of each meeting be a unique entry in the feed.  A very shallow look on the MediaWiki help pages seems to point to Wikipedia scraping the pages and then making an external feed for that...

== Completed Topics ==
* Permissions Wringing - Permissions need to be (thoroughly) tested to be sure the implementation matches the policy.
** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]: I think the permissions are working.  Everyone please check.
* Prettier URLS?
** YES!
** [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:%24wgActionPaths Action Paths] might help 
** [[User:Jmglov|jmglov]]: (withdrawn) <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red;">Along these lines, I recommend we make the page naming convention CamelCase, instead of the current Delimit_Words_With_Underscores conventions. What say ye?</span>
*** [[User:Zev|zev]]: Why would we want to do that?  I see we would loose the ability to express Topic titles that have spaces in them?
** At the very least let's trash the index.php header. See: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eliminating_index.php_from_the_url
** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]: Need someone with web-admin rights who can configure the apache config.  I don't have apache config rights.. Josh??  
* Logo - We need a TLUG specific wiki logo.  Which one should we use?
** How about our current TLUG penguin?
*** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]: Updated
* Admin only access section of Wiki?  I want to document various admin related things.  Some should be public, but some might not be appropriate?
** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]: This has '''been implemented'''.  Start documenting!
** Such as server software to monitor for security patches
* Time stamps in JST !!!!(Can we fix this soon?)
** This should be a simple setting in MediaWiki... when?
** I think we can change it through this variable: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:%24wgLocaltimezone
** And this :http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Timezone
** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]: '''This is done''' as of 2/5/2007
* Get the rest of the Wiki Admins online
** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]: '''Done''' at hackathon
** [[User:Jmglov|jmglov]] suggests:
*** List policy / FAQ
**** [[User:Hoanga|Al]]:Done
