== What happened in February? ==

== Food Place ==
We did the hacker special and bought food at a convenience store and took it to the CTI office:

== Meeting Place ==
Linux heaven! The CTI head offices with Linux machines coming out of the walls.

== Crazed Members Present ==
* [[Nori Nishigaya]] anishi@cyber.ad.jp,
* [[Craig Oda]] craig@twics.com,
* [[Steve Casmar]] casmar at twics.com,
* [[Jim Tittsler]] jwt at shrine.cyber.ad.jp,
* [[Mario Basa]] mbasa at twics.com,

== Summary of events ==
We got Xanim to display QuickTime videos. :-)
The hot topic was CGI scripts and we decided to talk about it a bit more at the next meeting. People were rapping about Perl and HTML. JWT showed us a cool Perl script that crawled through everyone's directory and created an index of home pages.

== Summary of Decisions ==
Kind of a laid-back meeting this time. :-)
