===== Presentations =====

====== Android's Security Architecture (by [[Nikolay Elenkov]]) ======
This talk will give an overview of Android's security architecture from
the bottom up, and present the major Android subsystems and components
that relate to device and data security. The talk will cover broader
topics that affect all applications, such as package and user management,
permissions and device policy, and will also touch on more specific ones
such as cryptographic providers, PKI, and credential storage. Some of the
changes introduced in the new Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) release will also
be explored.

====== Deduplicating Backup Schemes (by [[Jim Tittsler]]) ======
Attic/Borg and Restic are examples of modern backup programs that provide 
encryption, compression, and data integrity checks that are space efficient
even for massive files like virtual machine images. And there are convenience
features like mounting your backups as filesystems. Perhaps it is time to 
replace those old rsnapshot, rdiff-backup and duplicity scripts.

====== Wakame-vdc on Arch Linux (by [[Andreas Kieckens]]) ====== 
Wakame-vdc is an open source data centre virtualization suite that 
Andreas (and his colleagues) gets paid to develop. Though it officially 
only supports Centos, Andreas has been working on some scripts to get it 
up and running from scratch on Arch Linux using LXC and KVM.

During the presentation Andreas will briefly talk about what Wakame-vdc 
is, explain what the scripts do to set it up and talk about how he plans 
to use it to manage his multiple development and test environments
Full disclosure: The scripts are still in development and just how much 
will actually work during the presentation is going to be a surprise. :p

===== nijikai =====
After the presentations we will go for drinks somewhere around Gotanda Station.
