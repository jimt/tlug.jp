====== Using Linux to learn how to play guitar with TuxGuitar (by [[Andreas Kieckens]]) ======
TuxGuitar is a tool that allows you to compose music and download other people's compositions. 
It's focused mostly around guitar and is a great tool to learn the instrument.
Andreas will give a tour of the software and how he uses it to practice guitar playing
or write down music that he comes up with.

====== Adventures in Tail Call Optimization (by [[Travis Cardwell]]) ======

Tail call optimization is a feature of a programming language
(compiler or interpreter) that is essential for writing efficient
recursive functions.  Travis will explain tail call optimization and then
show its (mis)use in various programming languages, including some that
do not support it.
