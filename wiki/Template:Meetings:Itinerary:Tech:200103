=== Inside an Electronic Dictionary ===
This months topic will be presented by [[Jim Breen]] Visiting
Professor, at the Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures
of Asia and Africa, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Japan.

As Jim says.....

In the talk I intend to cover three aspects of what I have been doing
with electronic dictionaries and dictionary files over the last few
years:

* how the file(s) are structured, and why
* how they are indexed and searched. The good bits and the limitations.
* some of the implementation issues, as the files and techniques have been used on various platforms, both as stand-alone systems and servers.

If anyone is left awake, I'll mention where I'm going with the XML
formatted files, and some plans for expanding the WWW server, and
finally doing a cross-platform standalone version.
