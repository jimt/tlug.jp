I'll pass this on to Debian users from the Debian Laptop list.

''"I would like to get a list of all packages installed on a system, including their version in order to track the changes that has been made during a system upgrade."''

Suggested solutions:

    dpkg -l | awk '/^ii/{print $2, $3}'
    dpkg -l | grep ^ii

Chuck
