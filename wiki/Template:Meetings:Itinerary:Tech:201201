===== Presentations =====

====== "Honeypots and other open-source security tools from the Honeynet Project" by [[Benny Ketelslegers]] ======

The Honeynet Project is a leading international security research
organization, dedicated to investigating the latest attacks, developing
open source security tools to improve Internet security and learning how
malicious hackers behave.
In this presentation, we will learn what kind of honeypots there are, how
they are used and the insights they give into network/system attacks.
Secondly, a run-through will be given of the (open-source) tools provided
by the project and how to use them.

====== "Wakame-vdc" by [[Andreas Kieckens]] ======

Wakame-vdc is an open source IaaS system written in Ruby that runs on 
Ubuntu and OpenSolaris. During this presentation he will briefly explain 
what an IaaS system is and what advantages it has over a standard data 
centre. He will then cover several of Wakame's features and explain some 
of the bleeding edge software it uses. (such as virtualizing the network 
itself using OpenFlow.) If there's an internet connection available, 
there will also be a live demo.
