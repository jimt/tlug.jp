== Overview ==
The Phrase of the Week Project is intended to be a group effort to compare and exchange languages, and provide some level of insight into the languages used.  The goal is to take a commonly used Japanese phrase or idiomatic expression, and provide a literal English translation, explanation of usage and context, and a good idiomatic equivalent in English.

Others would then take the expression and translate it to other languages, along with a natural language equivalents, explanations and cultural notes for the phrases chosen.

At the end of the week, the editors will compile the results and post them to the TLUG Wiki, posting a link to the site in an RSS feed so that people can be notified of the changes.
