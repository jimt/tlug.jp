== Introduction ==

This technical meeting will be followed by the Bonenkai.

TLUG meetings will be announced on this page. We are always looking for people who would like to give demonstrations. If you have any ideas about meeting events, please let us know.

All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. Membership is open to anyone. There are currently no membership dues or entrance fees.

TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.

As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd SAT of odd numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd FRI of even numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.
