'''"Linux Storage - an introduction to FCoE/DCB"''' by ''[[Jack Morgan]]''

Linux storage options are growing with each release of the
Linux kernel. I will introduce Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and
it's adjacent technology Data Canter Bridging (DCB) for 10Gbe adapters.
I will cover some of the technical details of these two technologies,
discuss how to get them installed/configured on your system and provide
a demonstration, assuming we have Internet access. Here are a few links:
