== Introduction ==
All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.

TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.

As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.

The 5000 yen is for the Weber Park BBQ course and must be prepaid so
we can finalize the reservation. The cost for the boat ticket (1380
yen) and anything else will be split up at the time like we usually
do.

=== Details ===

We'll start out with a barbecue and open bar at Weber Park in
Odaiba. After that, we'll grab some drinks and hop on a boat for a 90
minute cruise to Asakusa. Once we get to Asakusa, we'll head over to
the Asahi Beer HQ for a nijikai.

This event is open to all Linux users and friends, and is to celebrate
TLUG's 25th Anniversary. Even if you're not a Linux user or a LUG
member, but want to hang out with Linux people, please come.
