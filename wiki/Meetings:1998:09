The Friday Nomikai at Tengu was another success, and 24 people came out to eat, drink, and talk linux :-)

We had a "mini-auction" of DRAM donated by Urs Roesch, and some network cards as well. That plus a donation from Hikaru and the change from the Nomikai gives us over 16,000 yen to go towards the Tlug library and other good tlug events.

Also, thanks to Cliff Miller and Scott Stone of PHT for donating copies of Applixware-J and Turbolinux 2.0E, and to Marcus Metzler for donating 4 O'Reilly books plus over 30 movies to the library. The Voyager and Deep Space Nine CD's were especially popular.

Now that we have some funds to put into materials, please contact Jonathan Byrne or talk to him at the next meeting about what software or books you would like to see in the library.

Thanks again to everyone who came out and helped celebrate!
