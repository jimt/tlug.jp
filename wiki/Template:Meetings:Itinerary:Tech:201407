====== Metasepi Report: Writing NetBSD Sound Drivers in Haskell (by [[Kiwamu Okabe]]) ======
Most strongly typed, functional programming languages are not equipped with a reentrant garbage collector.
Therefore such languages are not used for operating systems programming, where the virtues of types are most desired.
We propose the use of Context-Local Heaps (CLHs) to achieve reentrancy, which also increasing the speed of garbage collection.
We have implemented CLHs in Ajhc http://ajhc.metasepi.org/, a Haskell compiler derived from jhc http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/, rewritten some NetBSD sound drivers using Ajhc, and benchmarked them.
