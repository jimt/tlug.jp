====== "Bioinformatics as Viewed by a Computer Scientist" by [[Raymond Wan]] ======

[[Raymond Wan]] will introduce the field of bioinformatics
(or computational biology) from the perspective of someone with a
computing background.  Since no knowledge in biology is assumed, I will
begin with some basic concepts and then move into the types of data
being analyzed by others.  I will end with an overview of "second
generation sequencing" and how it relates with my current work.
