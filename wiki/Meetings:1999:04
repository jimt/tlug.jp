== Technical Meeting Topic ==
=== LabView for Linux ===
Engineers from Nihon National Instruments (http://www.natinst.com/nni/)
will come to show us LabView, a software for rapid prototyping/rapid
development of data acquision and control systems. It creates a virtual
workbench for signal processing and data analysis, transforming the
computer into a virtual instrumentation system. From their web page:

 "LabVIEW is a revolutionary graphical programming
  development environment based on the G programming language for data
  acquisition and control, data analysis, and data presentation. LabVIEW
  gives you the flexibility of a powerful programming language without
  the associated difficulty and complexity because its graphical programming
  methodology is inherently intuitive to scientists and engineers."

=== UDB/DB2 ===
IBM recently announced their commitment to support Linux, providing
hardware, software and support solutions for their customers. The DB2
Universal Database (http://www.ibm.co.jp/software/data or, for the page
in English, http://www.software.ibm.com/data) is one of IBM's leading
software products that is been ported to Linux. Engineers from IBM Japan
will come to give us a short introduction to Relational Data Base Systems,
explain the UDB basics and show the latest developments. They will also
give away CD-ROMs of DB2 for Linux at the meeting.

== Meeting Place ==
(map at http://www.tuj.ac.jp/maps.html)

The Temple University Japan (TUJ) Campus is located at 'San no Hashi'
(the street name is 'Sakurada Dori'). The DHC building across the street
has a HUGE four sided sign that says DHC. The 06 bus from Shibuya stops
at Furukawa-bashi, which is a one block walk away from TUJ. TUJ is in a
single big building with a sign out front, right on Sakurada Dori.

Cab drivers will take you right there if you ask for San no Hashi. It is a
15 minute walk from Tamachi, but while it is pretty straight forward, it
needs a map, as there are a couple of jogs in the route.

The 96 bus also stops there, and I think the 92 bus as well. It is a 20
minute walk from Hiro (Just go to Tengen-ji Bashi intersection and head
toward Azabu Ju-ban on Meijidori), or a minimum price cab ride from either
Hiro or Tamachi

Once in the university building, go up the stairs opposite the elevator to
the second floor, turn right down the hall to room 206. Of course you can
use the elevator as needed.
