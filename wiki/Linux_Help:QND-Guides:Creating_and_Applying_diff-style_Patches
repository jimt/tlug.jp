== Creating Patches with diff ==
In a shell, change to the directory where the file you wish to make a patch for is located. Copy the original file (before your edits) to the same directory (you '''did''' make a backup copy of it before you edited it, right?). Now, type in the shell:
 diff -uN original_file new_file >patch.original_file
where ''original_file'' is the filename of the original file and ''new_file'' is the filename of the new file (the one containing your edits).

This technique also works for creating a patch for a whole directory tree (e.g. creating a Linux kernel patch). Just add the -r flag to your diff command:
 diff -uNr original_dir new_dir >patch.original_dir

Here is a concrete example of creating a patch against the vanilla Linux kernel's source tree:
 cd /usr/src
 diff -uNr linux-2.4.19 linux-2.4.19-my_version \
   >patch.linux-2.4.19-my_version

That is all there is to creating patches with diff. Move on to [[#Applying Patches with Patch]] to see how to apply them with patch.

== Applying Patches with Patch ==
Copy the patch that you generated in Step 2 to the directory containing the file to which you want to apply the patch. Now, type in your shell:
 patch <patch_file
where ''patch_file'' is the filename of the patch file. Note that the filename of the file to be patched must be the same as it was in [[#Creating Patches with diff]].

If you want to apply a patch to a whole directory tree, add a -p1 to your patch command:
 patch -p1 <patch_file

Here is a concrete example of applying a patch to your Linux kernel source tree:
 cd /usr/src
 patch -p1 <patch.linux-2.4.19-my_version

Congratulations, you are finished.
