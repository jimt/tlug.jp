The 11th TLUG Nomikai was on January 14th. The event was open to all Linux users and friends, and promoted casual Linux (and non-Linux) related discussions over a few cold ones.

For those people who didn't know where Tengu is, Jonathan was waiting at Tokyo station Yaesu chuo ticket gate at 19:15. Here are some pictures of Yaesu Chuo ticket gate: Gate 1  Gate 2
