== Election ==

This year, we're looking to elect new president who can
serve the wonderful Tokyo Linux user community for the year
2003.

President's job includes organizing technical meetings,
(i.e., finding a meeting hall and speakers) set the general
direction for the group, boss around the other officers (just
kidding!) and promote the use of linux through technical
meetings and drinking parties.

Currently, the key positions are held by members listed below:

== Project at OSDL Japan ==

OSDL (Open Source Development Lab) currently hosts TLUG's server
free or charge in their Yokohama datacentre, on the condition 
that TLUG proposes a Linux-based project with them, for which 
they will provide development environment. This is a great way to 
contribute to the open source community. 

If you have any suggestions, please bring them here for us to 
discuss and participate in.
