== Limiting Search to Year and Month ==

The TLUG list urls have the following form

  <nowiki>http://tlug.jp/ML/</nowiki>[''y''][''m'']/msg['\d\d\d\d'].html

* ''y'' last two digits of year
* ''m'' month 01~12

e.g.

  http://tlug.jp/ML/9603/msg00170.html

This email was posted to the TLUG list in March 1996.  To find other emails posted in this month with the keyword "Linux"

  [http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:tlug.jp/ML/9603+Linux inurl:tlug.jp/ML/9603 Linux]

== Find Emails posted by specific person ==

quoting a phrase matches the phrase rather then the individual words so to find emails by a specific user use

  "From: [name]"

e.g.

  inurl:tlug.jp/ML/ "From: Jim Schweizer"

This seems to work reasonable well.

== Messages that have been linked to ==

If you want to find who has a link to something in the mail archives use.

  links:[url]

e.g. 

  [http://www.google.com/search?q=links:http://tlug.linux.or.jp/docs/linus.html links:http://tlug.linux.or.jp/docs/linus.html]

As shown above, this will work with any link not just the mail archives.  Remember tlug has had multiple domain names over the years so not all links point to tlug.jp.

== Pruning result by keyword ==

Sometimes the most appropriate word for searching the archive has another meaning.  To remove these irrelevant result place a negative before words found uniquely in these results.  This can be particularly useful for removing maillist.html and threads.html pages from the results.

e.g.

  [http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:tlug.jp/ML/+election+-IPU+-smb+-democrat+-council+-US+-maillist.html+-threads.html inurl:tlug.jp/ML/ election -IPU -smb -democrat -council -US -maillist.html -threads.html]

You could use this to search for messages on tlug elections and remove messages about samba domain elections and discussion about the US election.

this also works for sites so you could do

  [http://www.google.com/search?q=links:www.twics.com/~tlug/+-site:www.tlug.jp+-site:tlug.jp links:www.twics.com/~tlug/ -site:www.tlug.jp -site:tlug.jp]

to find all links to the old tlug site that aren't from the current site.
