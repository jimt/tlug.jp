= TLUG Wiki Edit HOWTO =

== Groups ==
We currently have 4 tiers of groups on this wiki
* tlug-admin - Have the power of a mediawiki bureaucrat + sysop. Only tlug-admins can approve users into 'tlug' group status.
* tlug - Authenticated users with normal mediawiki user rights
* user - May only view the wiki, can start talks (ok?)
* anonymous - May only view the wiki, no edits at all

== Becoming a TLUG User ==
# Create a wiki user account
# Make sure to authenticate yourself
# An email will be sent to the wiki admins pending for approval
# Wait to be approved into the '''tlug''' group
# Edit to your heart's content

== Becoming a TLUG Admin User ==
The same as Normal Users but you also need to become approved as a tlug wiki admin.  Ask on the TLUG admin mailing list until we have a process in place.

== Getting Started ==
# Create your user page so people can know who you are (create a user page even if you want to remain anonymous, even if you just put a witty remark there). Example: [[User:Jmglov]]
