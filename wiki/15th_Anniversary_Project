''A while back I linked the old meeting archives (most with some photos) [[Meetings:Archive | *here*]] in to the wiki.  So at least there are some pics, albeit very low res for the early digi cam pics.'' - [[User:Tim| Tim Meggs]]

=== Celebration Party ===
* The intention was to hold this on a Friday or Saturday night in June which seems to be around the time of the first meeting.
* We have had an expression of interest in sponsoring a TLUG anniversary party but nothing confirmed.
** Perhaps it would be better to look for a number of smaller sponsors rather then one individual sponsor.
* Depending on how many people are interested in attending it might be worth having this catered.
** Based on a the responses to initial announcement we expect at least 50 people would attend.
