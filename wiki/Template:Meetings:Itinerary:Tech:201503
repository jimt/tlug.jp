===== Presentations =====

====== An Exploration of Recursive Descent Parsing (by [[Benjamin Kowarsch]]) ======

This presentation will give a general overview of common parsing 
techniques and examine RD parsing in further detail. In particular it 
will show how to design, visualise and troubleshoot grammars suitable 
for RD parsing and how to transform such grammars into handwritten 
RD parsers. It will also give a brief overview how to use ANTLRworks 
for grammar evaluation and troubleshooting. Finally it will introduce 
an unnamed free open source script that generates publishing quality syntax diagrams.

====== X-COM and its open source remakes (by [[Andreas Kieckens]]) ======

X-COM is an old DOS game that combines world-wide strategy with small squad
turn-based tactics. It is not *too* famous, but people who've played it 
(including the presenter) often praise it as one of the best games ever made.
Over the years, a lot of game developers have attempted to recreate its magic. 
Several of these projects are open source and even more can run on Linux. 
This presentation will give an overview and show some of these games in action.

===== nijikai =====
After the presentations we will go for drinks somewhere around Gotanda Station.
