''Towards a “Humane Interface”: Back to the Future with the Canon Cat'' - by Karamoon

Dr. Emmett Brown famously said “'Where we're going, we don't need roads’. We do, however, need user interfaces that are fit for purpose.

As computing becomes not just ubiquitous but pervasive, we’re continually guided, funnelled, distracted, misled, entrapped and even assaulted (visually and aurally) by applications, by their interfaces and by the operating systems upon which our applications run.

In place of the “calm technology” proposed by Mark D. Weiser of Xerox PARC we have a noisy, messy computing environment. It’s an environment that gets in the way of what we want to do, instead of augmenting our ability as humans to get things done.

Do things have to be this way? Does the distant past offer us a scrap of hope?

What happened to Weiser’s four principles of ubiquitous computing? Have they been lost in time, like tears down the drain?
1. The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else.
2. The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant.
3. The more you can do by intuition the smarter you are; the computer should extend your unconscious.
4. Technology should create calm.

It’s almost impossible to imagine different ways of doing things. Surely computing must be the way it is. And yet…

This talk will look at Jef Raskin's M68000-based "Canon Cat”.

It’s an unusual computer and interesting computer released in 1987. Perhaps it gives us a glimpse into a possible future of human-computer interaction?

The most striking feature of the Canon Cat its lack of any software application; instead it consists of a single document with all functionality provided at OS-level. There are some other interesting points too such as the embedded Forth compiler, an assembly language, a novel file system, incremental search...
