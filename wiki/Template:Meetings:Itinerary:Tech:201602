===== Presentations =====

====== Digital Photography with Linux (by [[Alberto Tomita]]) ======
This presentation will introduce some of the digital photography applications available in Linux, from GIMP to Darktable, and going through a few others.


The first part will cover the very basics of photography and then introduce the concepts involved in digital photography, so that everyone (including beginners) can understand what the tools do. For intermediary and advanced photographers, this will also be a chance to review the basics and exchange ideas.
