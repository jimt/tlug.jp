==== Itinerary ====

===== Presentations =====

====== "Version Control Done Right" by [[Andreas Kieckens]] ======
A brief explanation of what Version control is and why 
Andreas uses GIT and not another one. Then he'll describe
a successful GIT branching system in detail and explain 
why you should use it.

====== "Debian on the Desktop: A Guide for Ubuntu Refugees" by [[Travis Cardwell]] ======
Many desktop environments these days offer premature mobile-
oriented user interfaces, gluttonous resource utilization, and over-
minimization.  This talk gives tips for overcoming these issues by setting
up a modern desktop on Debian 7.  Topics to be covered include the testing
distribution, backports, multiarch, third-party software installation, and
alternative window managers.
