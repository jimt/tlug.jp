This event is open to all Linux users and friends, and is
to promote casual Linux (and non-Linux) related discussions
over a few cold ones. Even if you're not a Linux user or a
LUG member, but want to hang out with Linux people, please come.

If you're coming, send an e-mail to tlug-admin@example.com
just to let us know so that we can reserve space at Tengu. If you
want to come at the last minute and don't send an e-mail, it's 
okay - we may have to squeeze a bit, but please come!

Tengu is about 5 minutes away from the Yaesu Chuo exit of the JR Tokyo
train station.  It is on the right hand side of Yaesu Dori if you are
walking out of the station.  If you are walking out of Yaesu exit, turn
the map upside down.

If you are coming via the underground mall, look for the Starbucks
across from McDonalds, and take the next exit on the left up to ground
level.
