===== Presentations =====

====== Introduction to Functional Programming: Hands-On with Racket (by [[Travis Cardwell]]) ======

Travis will give an interactive class on the basics of
functional programming using [http://racket-lang.org Racket], a dialect of
Scheme.  Please install Racket (not Minimal Racket) onto a laptop and bring
it with you to the meeting!

====== Adventures in Tail Call Optimization (by [[Travis Cardwell]]) ======

Tail call optimization is a feature of a programming language
(compiler or interpreter) that is essential for writing efficient
recursive functions.  Travis will explain tail call optimization and then
show its (mis)use in various programming languages, including some that
do not support it.

====== Discussion: Presentation Wish List ======

What kind of topics would you like to see at a future TLUG
technical meeting?  Travis will chair a discussion where we create a wish
list, which will later be posted to the mailing list so that any member
can pick a topic that they know about and share their knowledge at future
meetings.
