"AWS and deploying Linux with EC2"
By Mauro Sauco

This month, Mauro Sauco will be giving an introduction and demonstration
of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and in particular will be showing how to
deploy new Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs) to EC2.  He will also explain
how to manage instances.

If you are involved in a project or have something you would like to
talk about in this or a future technical meeting, we are always looking
for presenters.


Other items on the agenda are:
1. Introduction of new members, news about Linux/Open Source,
general announcements, Q&A
2. Auction
