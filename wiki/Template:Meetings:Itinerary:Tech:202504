"Introduction of open-source FPGA toolchains" by [[Yimin Gu]]

FPGAs are powerful devices, but the mindset different from software
development and the blackbox-like toolchains (and also ) makes it hard
to start on. Yimin Gu will introduce the status of the newly emerged
open-source FPGA toolchains. Some boards will be shown on-site.


"How efficient are architectures x86/aarch/RISC-V etc. for a workload?" by [[Christian Horn]]

Let's benchmark a cpu-bound workload over systems of various
architectures, while measuring power consumption.  Who will be most
energy efficient? Christian will introduce the test setup, talk a bit
about the used software.  Then details on the benchmarked workload
("bzcat"), on the various systems he benchmarked, and then introduce and discuss the results.

===== Other items on the agenda are: =====
# Introduction of new members
# News about Linux/Open Source, general announcements, Q&A
# Auction (bring any gear that would would like to donate to TLUG)
