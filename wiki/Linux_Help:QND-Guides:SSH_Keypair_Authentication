== Introduction ==
This guide instructs you on creating an SSH keypair to use for passwordless authentication. This solution should not be used for serious security; see instead [http://mah.everybody.org/docs/ssh ssh-agent].

== Generating a Keypair ==
To generate a keypair, run:
 ssh-keygen -t dsa
(you are advised not to protect the key with a password, as you will then be prompted for the password everytime you connect). The keypair will be saved (by default) in ''$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa'', and ''$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub'' (the .pub file is the public key, and the other is the corresponding private key).

== Setting Permissions ==
Now, set the permissions to protect your ''$HOME/.ssh/ directory''. (Note that these modes are the most lax permissions that these files and directories are allowed to  have. You may certainly set the permissions stricter.)
 chmod 711 $HOME/
 chmod 700 $HOME/.ssh/
 chmod 644 $HOME/.ssh/*
 chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa

== Adding Public Key to Remote authorized_keys Files ==
Finally, add the public key to the ''$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys'' file on each machine to which you wish to connect and set the correct permissions. (Note that you will be prompted for a password with each command. An alternative is to login to server and run the commands locally. If you do so, remove the quoting from the rightmost arguments.)
 cat $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub server 'cat >>.ssh/authorized_keys'
 ssh server chmod 711 "$HOME/"
 ssh server chmod 700 "$HOME/.ssh"
 ssh server chmod 644 "$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys"

For each machine you want to be able to connect from, first copy the ''id_dsa'' file (the private key) to that machine, then follow the above steps.
