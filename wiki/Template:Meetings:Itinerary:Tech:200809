===== << Presentation (1) >> =====
'''"ModSecurity - A Web Application Firewall that actually works"''' by ''Tomoyuki Sakurai''

In this session, I will introduce ModSecurity[http://www.modsecurity.org/ [1]], which is the most widely
deployed Web Application Firewall, licensed under GPL.

* [1] http://www.modsecurity.org/

All vulnerabilities are bugs. The best way to fix the vulnerability is
to fix the bug. However, sometimes we cannot do it for various reasons.
Still, we have to do something to prevent bad things from happening.

ModSecurity is an additional layer of security for Web applications. The
talk will include overview of ModSecurity, its use cases, deployment,
its latest feature and my Perl module to help deployment and operation.
