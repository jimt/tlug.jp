I envision the responsibilities of this position to be as follows, in order of decreasing importance:
# Actively encourage TLUG members to write high-quality articles that can be published on the TLUG site.
# Ensure that submitted articles meet minimal standards of quality as described above.
# Guide those articles through the submission process, as outlined by [[Articles:Policies:Process]].
# Work with the sysadmins to make sure our bandwidth can scale to handle demand for articles.
# Work with the author to publicise his articles.
# Recruit language-specific editors to provide the same services for articles written in languages other than English.

Due to the nature of the position, only native-level English speakers should apply.
