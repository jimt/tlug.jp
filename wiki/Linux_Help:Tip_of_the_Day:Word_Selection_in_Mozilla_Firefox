This one is stolen from the Env Improvement Ninjas at work--as Keith can attest--but it is too cool not to share.

Typically, double-clicking in the location bar in Firefox selects the whole URI. This is counter-intuitive to old Unix hackers, who are used to double-clicking on a word in ''xterm'' to select just that word. Here's how to correct this behaviour in Firefox:

# Open Firefox
# Enter about:config in your location bar and hit Enter
# Type in layout.word
# Two preferences should appear (both should default to false)
## layout.word_select.eat_space_to_next_word
## layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation
# Double-click on ''layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation'' to toggle it to true
# Close about:config
# Double-click in the location in Firefox and see what gets selected
