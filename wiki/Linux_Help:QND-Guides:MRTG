== Do You Have MRTG? ==
In a shell, type:
 which mrtg
This should return the path to ''mrtg'', probably ''/usr/bin/mrtg''. If it is found, continue to [[#Configuring MRTG]]. If it is not found, see [[Linux_Help:QND-Guides:Finding_and_Installing_Software]]

== Configuring MRTG ==
To generate an ''mrtg.cfg'' file, you can use the ''cfgmaker'' program (included in the MRTG distribution). In a shell, type:
 su - root
 mkdir /usr/local/mrtg
 cfgmaker --global 'WorkDir: /usr/local/mrtg' \
          --global 'Options[_]: bits,growright' \
          --output /etc/mrtg.cfg \
          community@router.my.domain

In the second command, you need to change the ''WorkDir'' directive to reflect the path where you want MRTG to generate its graphs and HTML pages. If you are running a webserver, it might make sense to have MRTG use a subdirectory of ''htdocs''. The Red Hat RPM suggested in this QND Guide actually creates the ''/var/www/html/mrtg'' directory, which is probably acceptable if you have installed Apache from the Red Hat RPM as well.

You will also need to change the bit of the command that says 'community@router.my.domain' to reflect the community string and hostname or IP address of whichever piece of networking hardware you will be using MRTG to monitor.

For more on ''cfgmaker'', type into a shell:
 man cfgmaker

== Letting MRTG Grab its Data ==
In a shell, type:
 su - root
 crontab -e

This will bring up root's crontab in a text editor (corresponding to your ''EDITOR'' environment variable). At the bottom, add the two lines:
 # Grab data for MRTG every five minutes
 */5 * * * * /usr/bin/mrtg /etc/mrtg.cfg

This will run the MRTG script every five minutes, using the config file that you created in [[#Configuring MRTG]]. If your ''mrtg'' script is installed in a difference place (type <pre>which mrtg</pre> to find out), replace the ''/usr/bin/mrtg'' with that path. Likewise, if you saved your config to a file other than ''/etc/mrtg.cfg'', substitute that file above.

== View the Results ==
Congratulations, you should be done. Fire up a web browser and point it at the directory (or URL, if you are running a webserver and you chose to put your MRTG data in its documents tree) that you specified in [[#Configuring MRTG]]. You should see plenty of colourful graphs.

== Chasing Dependencies ==
If you are reading this, you must be having a problem with dependencies that is keeping MRTG from installing. If this is not the case, stop reading this appendix.

The steps that you must follow to resolve your dependencies will again differ based on which distribution you run.

=== Red Hat, Mandrake, or other RPM-based Linux distro ===
The ''mrtg-2.9.17-3.i386.rpm'' RPM depends on the ''gd-devel'' package for generating the graphs. gd-devel has a few dependencies of its own. To fix the dependency problems, try the following steps:
# In a shell, type: <pre>rpm -q freetype-devel</pre> If the ''freetype-devel'' package is found, move onto the next step. If not, download the ''freetype-2.0.9-2.i386.rpm'' and ''freetype-devel-2.0.9-2.i386.rpm RPMs''. In a shell, change to the directory where you downloaded the RPMs and type: <pre>su - root&#13;rpm -Uvh freetype-2.0.9-2.i386.rpm freetype-devel-2.0.9-2.i386.rpm</pre> If the RPMs install with no problems, move onto the next step. If not, turn to your LUG.
# In a shell, type: <pre>rpm -q libjpeg</pre> If the ''libjpeg'' package is found, move onto the next step. If not, download ''libjpeg-6b-19.i386.rpm''. In a shell, change to the directory where you downloaded the RPM and type: <pre>su - root&#13;rpm -Uvh libjpeg-6b-19.i386.rpm</pre> If the RPM installs with no problems, move onto the next step. If not, turn to your LUG.
# Download ''gd-1.8.4-4.i386.rpm'' and ''gd-devel-1.8.4-4.i386.rpm'' files. In a shell, change to the directory where you downloaded the RPMs and type: <pre>su - root&#13;rpm -Uvh gd-1.8.4-4.i386.rpm gd-devel-1.8.4-4.i386.rpm</pre> If the RPMs install with no problems, return to Step 2 and try again. If not, turn to your LUG.
