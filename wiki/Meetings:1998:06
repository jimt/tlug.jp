== Meeting Topic ==

A talk on the Debian and RPM packaging systems for Linux was given by [[Stephen Turnbull]] and [[Scott Stone]]. Packaging systems allow easy installation and removal of Linux system software. The packaging systems come with powerful dependencies that inform the user what other programs are needed to ensure a functional Linux system. For example, the installation of the Japanese to English dicitionary xjdic is dependent on edict and kanjidic. An attempt to install xjdic with these packaging systems will result in a search of your system for edict and kanjidic. If the programs are not installed, the packaging system will tell you or install them for you over the Internet or from CD. The packaging systems allow the Linux user to find out information on every program on their system, learn the contents of software packages before installation, and find out what files were installed by what packages. Both rpm and dpkg come with a command line interface and a menu based interface.

How these packaging systems can be used for development of .rpm or .deb packages was also covered.

== About the Speakers ==

=== [[Stephen Turnbull]] ===

Mr. Turnbull spoke on the Debian packaging system. He is a long time Linux user and an early member of TLUG. Mr. Turnbull contributes to the development of XEmacs, is the maintainer of the elisp Japanese to English dictionary interface to edict, edict.el, and is one of the principal authors for an upcoming book on Japanese support of Linux to be published by O'Reilly Japan. Mr. Turnbull holds a doctorate in economics from Stanford University and is a professor at Tsukuba University in Japan when he is not hacking Linux.

His presentation covered these areas:

# Package management
## A fancier `tar'
## Distributions, dependencies, policies, and packages 
# User tools
## Package selection database: dselect

# Developer tools
## Anatomy of a package
## Building: dpkg-deb
## Packaging: dkpg-deb 
# Building packages
## Hello

** upgrading
** querying
*** information
*** file listings
*** checking rpm ownership of files
*** install/uninstall script listings
