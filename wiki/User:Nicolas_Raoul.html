<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://nrw.free.fr">Nicolas Raoul</a>, open source user and contributor since 1998. I am a software engineer with a passion for Java, XML and the Semantic Web. I learn Japanese and work on <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/">HTML5</a> at Tokyo's W3C office. I live in Shimokitazawa, one of the most exciting places in Tokyo, and I love to ride my bicycle around.</p>
<p>Happy hacking! Nicolas.</p>
